# Hebbian Learning for Autonomous Agents
This project is part of my M.Sc. Thesis. It demonstrates that autonomous (driving) agents can be trained using Hebbian learning, and attempts to optimize its control.

It is based on the Novelty Real-Time Autoencoder Augmented Hebbian Network (RAAHN)-algorithm.
